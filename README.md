London IT Contractors Group - Java Pair Programming Coding Sessions
------------------------------------

### Introduction
Pair Programming coding sessions play vital role in current IT development job assessments. Candidate is asked to pair with existing team developers and code on a problem within given time limits.If you don’t have prior experience of pair programming then it could be challenging for a candidate because everyone has their own preferred coding style.Clean Code principals must be followed to sail through these tests.In order to make yourselves comfortable and practice pair programming experience,IT Contractors Group is starting the online coding sessions where you can pair with other group members and get expertise feedback.

Sessions will be co-ordinated as:
- Duration: 1 Hours
- We will share Java code problem with instructions in the beginning.
- We will pair with you during the session and check your progress at regular intervals.
- We will give you feedback and discuss about your approach.

It will give you an experience of pair programming for cracking Job assessments.
It will be good opportunity to work on unknown problem and code it within a given time frame.
Our Team will connect with you in advance and make sure you are ready with setup before start of the session.


### Session Exercise
The following in the task we are going to work on in this session:

1. Shopping cart
  * You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.
  * Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
  * Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost (for example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => £2.05)
  * Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution (like list of strings as input)
2. Simple offers
  * The shop decides to introduce two new offers
    - buy one, get one free on Apples
    - 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
  * Update your checkout functions accordingly
